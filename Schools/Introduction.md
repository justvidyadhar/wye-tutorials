# Introduction to Programming with Python

Before you think about why Python, you should be clear about why you'd like to to do programming in general. 

The best way about thinking of programming is breaking down a **task** into fine steps and explaining it to someone on how to perform those steps in order to accomplish the **task**. Most often the person you're explaining the task to doesn't always understand your way of explaining the task. So you've to do it in a way they understand, in specific languages or order. If you're explaining it to a kindergarten kid, you'd explain it differently than a third grader. So basically you'd change your language when you speak to people with different levels of understanding of the world. 

You say **Computer Programming** when the **someone** you're explaining the tasks to is a computer instead of a real person. Unfortunately a computer is dumber than a kindergartener, so it doesn't understand our natural language. So people have build some intermediate **Apps**(I'm referring to the interpreter or compiler, which is too soon to introduce, so we'll just say apps for now.) that convert our explaination for a third grader or 8th grader to a computer.
